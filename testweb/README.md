# Vite React TypeScript Dapp Frontend

This project is a Vite-powered React TypeScript frontend for interacting with smart contracts in the `/contracts` directory. It includes integration with ethers.js, wallet connection, contract ABI loading, and a basic UI for contract interaction.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features
- Connect to Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask)
- Load contract ABIs from `/contracts`
- Interact with deployed smart contracts
- Modern React + TypeScript + Vite stack

## Customization
- Place your contract ABIs in a suitable location (e.g., `src/abis/`)
- Update the UI to match your contract methods and needs
