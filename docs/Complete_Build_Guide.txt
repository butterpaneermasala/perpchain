Price Feed Architecture

solidity

contract DataStreamOracle {
struct PriceData {
uint256 price;
uint256 timestamp;
uint256 roundId;
}
mapping(bytes32 => PriceData) public priceFeeds;

}

function updatePrice(bytes calldata priceData) external {
// Verify Data Streams signature
// Update price feed
// Emit price update event
}

4. Automation Setup
Liquidation Automation
Monitor position health ratios
Trigger liquidations when positions are underwater
Implement keeper-compatible functions
Gas-efficient liquidation logic
Automation Functions
solidity

function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata checkData)
external view returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData);
