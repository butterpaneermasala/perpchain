## Overview

This Solidity smart contract, **PerpetualTrading**, implements a cross-chain perpetual futures trading platform with Chainlink integration for price feeds and automation. It allows users to open leveraged long or short positions on various asset pairs, deposit/withdraw collateral, and supports automated liquidations and funding payments[1].

## Code Structure and Features

### **Imports and Inheritance**

- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**:  
  - `ReentrancyGuard`: Prevents reentrancy attacks.
  - `Pausable`: Allows pausing/unpausing the contract in emergencies.
  - `Ownable`: Restricts certain functions to the owner.
  - `IERC20` & `SafeERC20`: For safe ERC20 token operations.
- **Chainlink Contracts**:  
  - `AggregatorV3Interface`: For fetching price feeds.
  - `AutomationCompatible`: For automated tasks (e.g., liquidations).

The contract inherits from these modules to enhance security and functionality[1].

---

### **Constants**

- `PRECISION`: Decimal scaling (1e18) for calculations.
- `MAX_LEVERAGE`: Maximum leverage (100x).
- `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`: Margin at which liquidation occurs (80%).
- `LIQUIDATION_PENALTY`: Penalty (5%) taken on liquidation.
- `TRADING_FEE`: Trading fee (0.1%).
- `BASIS_POINTS`: Used for percentage calculations (100,000 = 100%)[1].

---

### **Enums**

- `PositionType`: `LONG` or `SHORT`.
- `PositionStatus`: `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, or `LIQUIDATED`[1].

---

### **Structs**

- **Position**:  
  Stores all details about a user's trading position (ID, trader, type, status, size, collateral, leverage, entry/liq. price, timestamps, asset pair).
- **MarketData**:  
  Information about each tradable asset pair (identifier, price feed, max leverage, maintenance margin, active status).
- **FundingRate**:  
  Per-asset funding rate and last update timestamp[1].

---

### **State Variables**

- **Mappings**:  
  - `positions`: Position ID → Position struct.
  - `userPositions`: User address → array of position IDs.
  - `markets`: Asset pair → MarketData.
  - `fundingRates`: Asset pair → FundingRate.
  - `userCollateral`: User → Token → Amount.
  - `supportedTokens`: Which tokens can be used as collateral.
  - `tokenPriceFeeds`: Collateral token → Price feed.
  - `crossChainPositions`: Tracks cross-chain positions.
  - `positionsToLiquidate`: Tracks positions marked for liquidation.
- **Other Variables**:  
  - `nextPositionId`, `totalVolume`, `totalFees`, `feeRecipient`, `liquidationBot`, `ccipReceiver`[1].

---

### **Events**

- Log key actions: position opened/closed/liquidated, collateral deposited/withdrawn, funding rate updated[1].

---

### **Modifiers**

- `onlyLiquidationBot`: Restricts to liquidation bot or owner.
- `onlyCCIPReceiver`: Restricts to CCIP receiver.
- `validMarket`: Ensures the market is active[1].

---

### **Key Functions**

#### **Market and Collateral Management**

- `addMarket`: Owner adds a new trading market with price feed, leverage, and margin settings.
- `addSupportedToken`: Owner adds a new collateral token and its price feed[1].

#### **Collateral Operations**

- `depositCollateral`: User deposits supported ERC20 tokens as collateral.
- `withdrawCollateral`: User withdraws collateral, ensuring positions remain sufficiently collateralized[1].

#### **Trading Operations**

- `openPosition`:  
  - User opens a leveraged long/short position.
  - Checks leverage, collateral, calculates required collateral, fees, liquidation price, and reserves collateral.
  - Emits `PositionOpened` event.
- `closePosition`:  
  - User closes their open position.
  - Calculates PnL, funding payment, exit fee, settles position, emits `PositionClosed`.
- `liquidatePosition`:  
  - Liquidation bot/owner can liquidate undercollateralized positions.
  - Calculates penalty, marks position as liquidated, emits `PositionLiquidated`[1].

#### **Funding Rate Management**

- `updateFundingRate`: Owner updates the funding rate for an asset pair[1].

#### **Chainlink Automation**

- `checkUpkeep`:  
  - Called by Chainlink to check if any positions need liquidation.
  - Returns list of liquidatable positions.
- `performUpkeep`:  
  - Called by Chainlink automation to liquidate eligible positions in batch[1].

#### **Internal Helper Functions**

- `_getAssetPrice`: Fetches latest price from Chainlink for asset pair.
- `_getCollateralValue`: Calculates user's collateral value in USD.
- `_convertUSDToToken`: Converts USD amount to token amount using price feed.
- `_calculateLiquidationPrice`: Computes liquidation price for the position.
- `_calculatePnL`: Computes profit/loss for a position.
- `_calculateFundingPayment`: Computes funding payment owed by/owed to position.
- `_isLiquidatable`: Checks if position is eligible for liquidation.
- `_canWithdrawCollateral`: Ensures withdrawal won't undercollateralize user.
- `_getTokenValue`: Gets USD value of a token amount.
- `_settlePosition`: Handles settlement logic (simplified in this code)[1].

#### **View Functions**

- `getPosition`, `getUserPositions`, `getMarketData`, `getUserCollateral`: For querying state[1].

#### **Admin Functions**

- `setCCIPReceiver`, `setLiquidationBot`, `setFeeRecipient`: Owner can update key addresses.
- `pause`, `unpause`: Owner can pause/unpause contract.
- `emergencyWithdraw`: Owner can withdraw all tokens from contract in emergencies[1].
